                    Joshua deLorimier is a new media artist, software 
                    developer and interactive motion graphics designer. 
                    Due to his passion for the real-time integration of 
                    sound and music, Joshua has crafted a career around 
                    the design of audio reactive visuals and artwork for 
                    live stage concert situations. Joshua has designed and 
                    performed visuals with acclaimed musicians spanning
                    multiple genres. He creates custom software designs with 
                    mathematical algorithms to produce immersive interactive 
                    experiences with the accompanying music. He is trained 
                    formally in motion graphics and film editing from 
                    Wilmington University in Wilmington, DE and Video 
                    Symphony in Burbank, CA.

                        Joshua works fluently with 3D packages and 2D design tools. 
                        He builds custom modified software designed specifically to 
                        handle his unique and meticulous workflow. Joshua believes 
                        that the tools used in the production of creative work are 
                        as influential to the process as the artist themselves. 
                        In the last year, he has expanded his portfolio with 
                        numerous works including an installation entitled 
                        “Algorithmic Structures” which was displayed at a local
                        venue in Newark, Delaware. Joshua has recently begun working 
                        on mobile platforms and is currently concentrating on
                        developing virtual reality software.
